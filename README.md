## Description
Hello, my name is Jason Ma. This application is called Write_Some_Notes.
              
Description:
This is a homework assignment for UWBOOTCAMP. This application uses node.js, Express, FS, to store and render values. We primarily use localhost server architecture to GET and POST data from db.json. This application is meant to demonstrate how a business owner would store notes.             
          
Coding Process
Lots of trial and error. I first did not understand express GET and POSt commands. I had to refer to class lecture and notes + online resources. The hardest part was converting ccode from one type to anoteher from DB.JSON output to output that can be read and processed in index.js.
